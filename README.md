# The Cartographer
A sophisticated, lightweight solution for creating comprehensive project documentation and architecture maps. The Cartographer is designed to help onboard new team members and maintain clear project understanding through automated documentation.

The prompt will create a folder in your root directory called cartography and it will create a new version to cartography every time you run the prompt.


## Overview

The Cartographer is a prompt-based solution that creates detailed, accurate maps of your codebase and project architecture. It works seamlessly with various AI coding assistants and requires no installation - it's just a prompt that you can use anywhere.

## Key Features

- **Zero Installation**: Works as a standalone prompt with any AI coding assistant
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Creates detailed maps of your entire codebase
- **Versioned Output**: Maintains history of project documentation
- **Visual Architecture**: Includes Mermaid diagrams for clear visualization
- **Concise Format**: Keeps documentation under 500 lines while maintaining completeness

## How It Works

The Cartographer follows a systematic approach to document your project:

1. Performs a complete scan of your project structure
2. Processes files in manageable batches
3. Creates versioned documentation files
4. Generates visual architecture diagrams
5. Maintains a clear record of project evolution

## Usage

Simply provide the cartographer.json prompt to your AI coding assistant. The Cartographer will:

- Create a new versioned documentation file
- Document all project files and their purposes
- Generate architecture diagrams
- Maintain a clear record of project structure

## Best Practices

- Use with an established role in your AI coding assistant for best results
- Run The Cartographer regularly to keep documentation up to date
- Review generated documentation for accuracy
- Use the documentation to onboard new team members

## Benefits

- **Quick Onboarding**: New team members can quickly understand project structure
- **Clear Architecture**: Visual representation of project components
- **Maintainable Documentation**: Versioned, concise, and up-to-date
- **No Setup Required**: Works immediately with any AI coding assistant

## Future Development

The Cartographer is continuously evolving. Future improvements will focus on:

- Enhanced visualization capabilities
